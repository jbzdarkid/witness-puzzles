SHIP BLOCKERS

BUGS
- Right click to remove start/end doesn't respect symmetry rules
- Audio is laggy -- Try preloading?
- "Serenâœ©: I let Witness Puzzles run until it resolved. It found some... questionable results."

- Solution viewer shows wrong solution on solve
- iOS is scrolling while solving, looks like I broke this when I tried to fix android.
- Android is still fairly buggy.
  - while solving a puzzle the page scrolling is annoying af, practically not even usable
  - it only does the annoying scrolling in editor
  - also sensitivity is scuffed
  - if you re tap on an incomplete path and go down it can refresh the page
  - doing that also lags tf out of the line rendering properly
- Some nonsense with floodfill going *through* single lines, which of course makes everything *weird*.
- Puzzle titles are overlapping with the rest of the menu bar (on play_template)
- Perf:
  * Early validate for triangles... specifically 1 & 2 (if they have 2/3 sides covered)
  * Find a way to make color counts cheaper, *especially* when there are no elements that care.
  * https://webpagetest.org/result/210722_AiDcS6_eb9ed4f976a30bb47350686c9e404676/
    (FCP on the main page is 1s, could be faster)
  * performance.mark apparently appears in devtools, which sounds actually useful
  * performance.getEntriesByType('resource')
  * source-map-explorer
  * coverage-ext sam saccone
  * pollyfill.io ?

- editor is a bit buggy with manual/auto solve mode

FEATURES
- Add send_last_lines from speedrunbot and send that when we 500.
- Autocommit for the database?
  from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
  db = SQLAlchemy(session_options={'autocommit': True})
- Dedupe telemetry rows by error text (and show a count of unique/total session IDs?)
  Ensure that "delete" deletes *all* rows that share that identifier.
- Telemetry page is only semi-compatible with dark theme; fix table borders & buttons
- Create a boolean which governs the early-validation logic, and compute it at entry. Also, don't run this logic for triangle-only puzzles, it's clearly not faster.
- Try to make webcrow async, even a little bit -- the lag when waiting on a click is not ideal.
- Clicking the Auto-Solve repeatedly makes the progress bar freak out and displays the wrong number of solutions.
- There is also no way to cancel an auto-solve, and
- it is possible to edit the puzzle while the auto-solve is loading, causing an incorrect number of solutions.
- symmetry puzzles should still show line colors when solved (Add two more fade colors, shouldn't be too too hard)
  Also, add MONOCHROME_SYMMETRY.
  This is about coloring. It should probably wait until I steal the css variables from prodzpod.
- Editor undo/redo
  > Only for active puzzle
  > Keep in-memory (do not write to local storage)
  > Linear (overwritten once a change is made)
  Just keep an array of serialized puzzles and an index, then when you call writePuzzle it should splice at index.
  Undo & Redo w/ gray out once we hit the limit. Pretty easy IMO.
  *** (This probably should only happen once I have new serialization. Just for memory consumption reasons.) ***
  Also hook C-Z and C-Y and C-S-Z
- Reduce puzzle serialization size? [WIP, test against editor (again) before shipping.]
  This is the main play I have against people attacking my system -- make it harder to send bad data.
- Per-puzzle statistics, using new telemetry table
  - Number of solves
  - Completion rate
  - avg Completion time
- Steal back stuff from prodzpod (https://github.com/prodzpod/witness)
  - CSS variables in engine/display2.js, engine/svg.js, engine.utilities.js, theme/*.css
  - Editor layout is a bit tighter -- consider smaller buttons & more rows?
  - engine/custom_mechanics.js (and also engine/polyominos.js) (and also engine/validate.js, carefully)
  - maybe engine/play.js
  - steal some svg shapes from engine/svg.js
  - trace2.js
- login-gated page for "show (and dismiss) all errors/feedback"
- Put the license *somewhere* into the header, so that if someone clones the repo they don't have to do it.
- Track puzzle solve count + solve duration, then provide a way to sort puzzles by count/duration (maybe only visible on /browse, or maybe not ever visible?)
  Part 1 shipping whenever AWS stops screwing me.
- RGB filters
- Support OUT_OF_BOUNDS_POLY
- Changing theme (or otherwise refreshing the browse/ page) does not retain your scroll offset
  Maybe use a fragment for this? Then, on reload, auto-scroll until we reach the fragment?
  Fragment should probably be a puzzle ID, not an offset. Wellll maybe not, what if we delete one?
- Retake all images (due to new background style) [WIP]
  Also, I should take images in dark theme, and have some way to show the appropriate ones.
  Some complaints about background color being too close to line color? Make background brighter. Just a bit.
  Complaint about contrast between black and background on the dark theme.
  Ok, I think it's time for a script to finish this.
- Some graphical indication that cancel actually fired?
  Hard, because we don't have an easy differentation between 'we got results bc cancelled' and 'we got results bc finished'. I guess we could set a flag...
- Work on speedrunning solver / improving "unique puzzles"
  Can't do this just with a cache key -- but I can recompute the key for all the regions after the fact.
  Or I could make a key for the puzzle as a whole? Regardless, not as easy as just hacking the cache key.
and move on.
- Editor dot button should act like triangles
  Hard, requires changing when the style changes
- No need for "Mouse Speed 2D" on mobile.
- Work on making a stable (github pages) version of WP
  Database needs to be checked in (can be fetched via XMLHttpRequest)
  Folder layout probably needs to change, though now that prod is hosting a gh-pages version, I can try to support both at once.
  Validation & database additions can be done via github issues + github actions (or some other public forum...)
    Hopefully this can do validation & pictures too.
    images need to be checked in, so git commit as part of the github action.
    Might want a separate DB repo, if only to avoid the commit spam.
- Custom mechanics
- pillar puzzles are too easy when you can see the whole thing.
- Add a "Save screenshot to clipboard" button
  Needs some actual support from javascript. Soon!
-- Add all puzzles in the game to the system. Maybe a separate category / identifier?
    Add tests & speedrunner solver

Tutorial
-- Internal names:
  dots (aka hexagons)
  stones (aka squares)
  shapers (aka polyominos, tetrominos, tetris)
  erasers (aka negations, deleters, eliminators)
  groupers (aka stars, suns)
  counters (aka triangles, doritos)
  [proposed custom mechanics]
    sizers (aka
-- Make a list of all the differences from the game (each needs a tutorial or a setting)
    Have a 'left/right arrows' with a bunch of puzzle images (or maybe animated static objects)
    [image]\n[explanation]\n[left arrow] step # [right arrow]
-- Need to explain complex mechanics
    Double negation
    Polys outside the grid
    Poly overlapping
    Precise polyominos
    Two-stage negation
-- Sadly, need to explain normal mechanics
    The best option here is to cherry-pick puzzles from the base game.
    That way, people can recognize mechanics. That said, since I'll provide text, there's no reason to go that slowly.
-- Should also have an explanation for the different 'styles' (which is probably how I'll implement settings)
