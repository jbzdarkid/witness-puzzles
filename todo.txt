- Work on speedrunning solver / improving "unique puzzles"
  Simplest approach is just to have a simpler cache key, which is content-aware.
- Perf TODOS:
  * Early validate for triangles... specifically 1 & 2 (if they have 2/3 sides covered)
- Editor resize is outright broken. Somehow.
  As is 'change puzzle type'. Yikes! Let's bug bash the editor.

Browse
-- "Jump to top" button
-- Batched list generation
    Infinite scrolling?
    Consider preloading puzzles in the python layer.
-- Sorting
    Date (default, currently implemented)
    Solve count?
    Popularity? (-> rating system)
    By mechanic?

Editor
-- R symmetry pillars are just broken, resizing them does amazingly dumb stuff
-- Changing type to R symmetry pillar still is buggy. See tests.
-- Empty title should probably "work", maybe have an explicit 'title box'?
-- Clicking 'solve manually' should probably clear auto-solution
-- Look into "cancel" solving? Might be hard, since I'm on main thread.
    Hard, look into old worker code
-- Crayons could be colored in, maybe.
-- At the full drag limit, start points can shift by 0.5 cells
-- Decide if shape chooser should pop over the right buttons or not.
-- Just lower the max puzzle size. 8x8 max? 10 just seems... humongous.
-- Add support for different rulesets. Also add tests for different rulesets (probably just add'l counts for each set).

Tracing
-- Tracing down against walls and gap-2 is awkward
    The game is awful at this too.
-- "inRawBbox" should potentially finish drawing the path, but leave the cursor as-is
    If it makes it easier, rm cursor when finishing

Server
-- Start versioning JS? That way caching works and doesn't shoot me in the foot.
-- Sign-in?

Tutorial
-- Make a list of all the differences from the game (each needs a tutorial or a setting)
    Have a 'left/right arrows' with a bunch of puzzle images (or maybe animated static objects)
    [image]\n[explanation]\n[left arrow] step # [right arrow]
-- Need to explain complex mechanics
    Double negation
    Polys outside the grid
    Poly overlapping
    Precise polyominos
    Two-stage negation
-- Sadly, need to explain normal mechanics
    The best option here is to cherry-pick puzzles from the base game.
    That way, people can recognize mechanics. That said, since I'll provide text, there's no reason to go that slowly.
-- Should also have an explanation for the different 'styles' (which is probably how I'll implement settings)

Low Prio / Misc
-- Shift-click should jump by 10 in showSolution
-- "Edit this puzzle"?
-- Add all puzzles in the game to the system. Maybe a separate category / identifier?
    Add tests & speedrunner solver
-- Add 'happy' to feedback?
-- Favicon still needs improving
    RM the dot, it's invisible
    Figure out something better for the tri (star?)
-- Animation for start-grow isn't playing for primary line
-- Improvements to publish.py
    Javascript versioning/hashing would be nice
-- Fix generation colors / general improvements to random puzzles
    >general support for random puzzles
-- transform: scale(2) doesn't work on safari?
    Checkboxes are terrible. Maybe write my own?
-- random generation for challenges
    copy game RNG should be easy (now that I do it myself)
    use trace callback func
    maze can be 'click to reveal' like memory card game
    should play the music if I can
-- Nightly builds? https://semaphoreci.com/jbzdarkid/jbzdarkid-github-io/settings
-- Mobile UI is terrible / non-functional.
-- Update deps (?)
-- Formal object for lines?
    Search for everything that calls setcell/getcell/grid reference, and see if it makes it better or worse.
