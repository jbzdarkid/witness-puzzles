SHIP BLOCKERS
- Cannot scroll the page on Android (revert previous "fix")

BUGS
- Android dragging is busted (resizing puzzles & manual solving)
- Some nonsense with floodfill going *through* single lines, which of course makes everything *weird*.
- Puzzle titles are overlapping with the rest of the menu bar (on play_template)
- Make buttons on iOS react to onpointerdown rather than onclick?
  - git g onclick engine/
- Editor puzzle title isn't selecting all text on desktop, it looks like the onclick is continuing through.
- Editor grid is off-center when smaller than 4x4 (again)
- Change style is not being saved (even though puzzle isn't modified, we should still save the style change)
- Perf:
  * Early validate for triangles... specifically 1 & 2 (if they have 2/3 sides covered)
  * Find a way to make color counts cheaper, *especially* when there are no elements that care.

FEATURES
- Put the license *somewhere* into the header, so that if someone clones the repo they don't have to do it.
- Track puzzle solve count + solve duration, then provide a way to sort puzzles by count/duration (maybe only visible on /browse, or maybe not ever visible?)
- RGB filters
- Reduce puzzle serialization size? [WIP]
  This is the main play I have against people attacking my system -- make it harder to send bad data.
- Add OUT_OF_BOUNDS_POLY to puzzle.settings
  "If true, polyominos may be placed partially off of the grid as an intermediate solution step."
- Light and Night theme
- Add maximum puzzle limit for WP (and remove QuotaExceededError)
- Changing theme (or otherwise refreshing the browse/ page) does not retain your scroll offset
  Maybe use a fragment for this? Then, on reload, auto-scroll until we reach the fragment?
- Retake all images (due to new background style) [WIP]
  Also, I should take images in dark theme, and have some way to show the appropriate ones.
  Some complaints about background color being too close to line color? Make background brighter. Just a bit.
  Ok, I think it's time for a script to finish this.
- Some graphical indication that cancel actually fired?
  Hard, because we don't have an easy differentation between 'we got results bc cancelled' and 'we got results bc finished'. I guess we could set a flag...
- Work on speedrunning solver / improving "unique puzzles"
  Can't do this just with a cache key -- but I can recompute the key for all the regions after the fact.
  Or I could make a key for the puzzle as a whole? Regardless, not as easy as just hacking the cache key.
and move on.
- Editor dot button should act like triangles
  Hard, requires changing when the style changes
- No need for "Mouse Speed 2D" on mobile.
- Work on making a stable (github pages) version of WP
  Database needs to be checked in (can be fetched via XMLHttpRequest)
  Layout probably needs to change
  Validation & database additions can be done via github issues + github actions (or some other public forum...)
    Hopefully this can do validation & pictures too.
    images need to be checked in
- Custom mechanics

Browse
-- Sorting
    Date (default, currently implemented)
    Solve count?
    Popularity? (-> rating system)
    By mechanic?

Editor
-- Pillar + resize is still horrendously broken.
-- Look into "cancel" solving? Just set max solutions to 0 (and use + to indicate uncertainty)
   Seems like this doesn't actually abort quickly, for some reason. Try to use the profiler?
-- Add support for different rulesets. Also add tests for different rulesets (probably just add'l counts for each set).

Tracing
-- Tracing down against walls and gap-2 is awkward
    The game is awful at this too.
-- "inRawBbox" should potentially finish drawing the path, but leave the cursor as-is

Server
-- Sign-in?

Tutorial
-- Internal names:
  dots (aka hexagons)
  stones (aka squares)
  shapers (aka polyominos, tetrominos, tetris)
  erasers (aka negations, deleters, eliminators)
  groupers (aka stars, suns)
  counters (aka triangles, doritos)
  [proposed custom mechanics]
    sizers (aka
-- Make a list of all the differences from the game (each needs a tutorial or a setting)
    Have a 'left/right arrows' with a bunch of puzzle images (or maybe animated static objects)
    [image]\n[explanation]\n[left arrow] step # [right arrow]
-- Need to explain complex mechanics
    Double negation
    Polys outside the grid
    Poly overlapping
    Precise polyominos
    Two-stage negation
-- Sadly, need to explain normal mechanics
    The best option here is to cherry-pick puzzles from the base game.
    That way, people can recognize mechanics. That said, since I'll provide text, there's no reason to go that slowly.
-- Should also have an explanation for the different 'styles' (which is probably how I'll implement settings)

Low Prio / Misc
-- "Edit this puzzle"?
-- Add all puzzles in the game to the system. Maybe a separate category / identifier?
    Add tests & speedrunner solver
-- Favicon still needs improving
    RM the dot, it's invisible
    Figure out something better for the tri (star?)
-- Fix generation colors / general improvements to random puzzles
    >general support for random puzzles
-- random generation for challenges
    copy game RNG should be easy (now that I do it myself)
    use trace callback func
    maze can be 'click to reveal' like memory card game
    should play the music if I can
-- Update deps (?)
